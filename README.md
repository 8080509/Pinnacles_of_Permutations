# Pinnacles of Permutations

Here we highlight two methods, `pinGen1` and `pinGen2`.

- `pinGen1` is the naive implementation for producing all permutations with a given pinnacle set.
- `pinGen2` is the new implementation, which is _much_ more efficient.

Note that each of these methods return iterators as opposed to lists.
